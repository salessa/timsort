This project is to pull timsort source code out of python and java source codes so that anyone who is not familiar with python development can easily use this highly optimized sorting algorithm.

As for the license of the source code, my intent was to adopt Python's license (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.2/license/), but obviously, googlecode does not provide it. So I have decided to go with BSD's.

Tim Peter's description found in the Python's source code : http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt
